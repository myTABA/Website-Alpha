## Things to do:
1. Once the axios promise is implemented for retrieval of data, a useState hook needs to replace the `data` variable. This is so that when the promise returns the data asynchronously,the component will update.
2. Similarly, if the filter list needs to be reimplemented the same way, the useState hook will e required to replace the elements.
