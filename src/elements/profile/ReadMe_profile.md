The profile page is the entry point to the page. 

Account page is currently the only other page here. For other sections, i recommend a new jsx file.

## Items to be done:
1. Adding the Liked and Saved Destination pages
2. If security tab needs to be removed, delete the thing from `changeState()` as well as from the return value, the `<button>`
